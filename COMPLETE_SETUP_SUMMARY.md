### Pipeline Stages
1. **Setup**: Environment configuration and OIDC setup
2. **Lint and Test**: Code quality checks and unit tests
3. **Security Scan**: SAST, SCA, and IaC security scanning
4. **Build and Package**: Lambda function packaging and signing
5. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Terraform infrastructure deployment
6. **Deploy Lambda**: Blue-green Lambda deployment with CodeDeploy
7. **Integration Tests**: Post-deployment validation
8. **Manual Approval**: Production deployment gate
9. **Rollback**: Automatic and manual rollback capabilities

### Security Features
- **Code Scanning**: CodeQL SAST analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit for vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Checkov for IaC security
- **Security Hub Integration**: Centralized security findings
- **Code Signing**: Optional Lambda package signing
- **Encrypted Storage**: All artifacts encrypted at rest

## 🚀 Ready to Use

### Test Your Pipeline

#### Option 1: Manual Trigger
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/snblaise/serverlessapplication
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Select **Lambda CI/CD Pipeline** workflow
4. Click **Run workflow**
5. Select **staging** environment
6. Click **Run workflow**
