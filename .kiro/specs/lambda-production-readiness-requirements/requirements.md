# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive Production Readiness Requirements (PRR) package specifically designed for AWS Lambda serverless workloads in regulated financial services environments. The package provides production-grade requirements, evidence-based controls, guardrails, operational runbooks, and CI/CD automation to ensure Lambda systems can pass go-live reviews and maintain compliance with standards like ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST CSF.

The deliverable includes structured documentation, policy-as-code implementations, operational procedures, and ready-to-use CI/CD workflows that enforce security, reliability, and compliance controls for Lambda-based microservices with API Gateway, EventBridge, SQS, and SNS integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a principal serverless architect in a regulated financial services company, I want a comprehensive Production Readiness Requirements document for AWS Lambda workloads, so that I can ensure all serverless systems meet production-grade standards and pass compliance audits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the PRR document THEN the system SHALL include non-functional requirements covering availability SLOs (99.9%), latency budgets, throughput limits, DR/BCP (RTO ≤ 4h, RPO ≤ 15m), data retention, and cost KPIs
2. WHEN defining security baseline THEN the system SHALL specify least-privileged IAM execution roles, permission boundaries, AWS Secrets Manager integration, Lambda Code Signing requirements, VPC networking controls, and AWS WAF protection
3. WHEN documenting Lambda runtime requirements THEN the system SHALL include version management with aliases, CodeDeploy canary deployments, reserved/provisioned concurrency, timeout configuration, idempotency patterns, and DLQ/failure destinations
4. WHEN specifying event sources THEN the system SHALL cover API Gateway integration, EventBridge rules, SQS redrive policies, SNS subscription policies, and S3 event configurations
5. WHEN defining observability requirements THEN the system SHALL mandate AWS Lambda Powertools, X-Ray tracing, structured logging, CloudWatch alarms, and operational runbooks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compliance auditor, I want a detailed control matrix mapping requirements to AWS services and evidence artifacts, so that I can verify that all production controls are properly implemented and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the control matrix THEN the system SHALL provide a table with columns for Requirement, AWS Service/Feature, How Enforced/Configured, Automated Check/Test, and Evidence Artifact
2. WHEN populating the matrix THEN the system SHALL include at least 40 rows covering identity, code signing, secrets management, network controls, API throttling, version management, concurrency, retry/DLQ handling, observability, CI/CD, disaster recovery, and cost management
3. WHEN mapping controls THEN the system SHALL reference specific AWS Config rules, CloudWatch metrics, CloudTrail events, and other measurable evidence sources
4. WHEN documenting enforcement THEN the system SHALL specify automated checks, policy configurations, and monitoring thresholds for each control

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want policy-as-code guardrails that automatically enforce production standards, so that non-compliant Lambda deployments are prevented and compliance violations are detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Organizations SCPs THEN the system SHALL deny lambda:UpdateFunctionCode unless Code Signing Config is attached, restrict regions, and require encryption/tracing tags
2. WHEN creating AWS Config conformance pack THEN the system SHALL include managed and custom rules for Lambda settings, VPC configuration, CMK encryption, API Gateway WAF association, and concurrency limits
3. WHEN defining CI policy checks THEN the system SHALL provide Checkov configurations, terraform-compliance rules, CodeQL setup, and Dependabot configuration
4. WHEN creating IAM permission boundaries THEN the system SHALL restrict CI roles from wildcard permissions, enforce tagging requirements, and limit production access to workflow environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an on-call engineer, I want detailed operational runbooks for common Lambda incidents, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve production issues following standardized procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling 5XX/throttle spikes THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step procedures for checking metrics, identifying recent deployments, performing rollbacks, and adjusting concurrency
2. WHEN dealing with poisoned SQS messages THEN the system SHALL include procedures for queue isolation, message replay, idempotency fixes, and timeout adjustments
3. WHEN rotating secrets THEN the system SHALL provide procedures for Secrets Manager rotation, environment updates, canary deployment, and verification steps
4. WHEN upgrading Lambda runtime THEN the system SHALL include procedures for testing, staging deployment, canary promotion, and production rollout
5. WHEN documenting incident flows THEN the system SHALL include Mermaid diagrams showing decision trees and escalation paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want a production readiness checklist that validates all controls are in place, so that I can confidently approve Lambda workloads for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the checklist THEN the system SHALL organize items by categories: Identity, Code Integrity, Secrets, Network, API/Events, Runtime & Reliability, Observability, CI/CD, DR, Cost, and Compliance
2. WHEN defining checklist items THEN the system SHALL provide Yes/No validation points that link to specific evidence in the control matrix
3. WHEN completing the checklist THEN the system SHALL ensure all critical production controls are verified before go-live approval
4. WHEN referencing evidence THEN the system SHALL provide clear links to automated checks, configuration settings, and monitoring dashboards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a solutions architect, I want reference diagrams showing Lambda request flows and CI/CD pipelines, so that I can understand the complete system architecture and data flows for design reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating request flow diagrams THEN the system SHALL show Client → API Gateway (+WAF) → Lambda (optional VPC) → DynamoDB/S3/3P API paths with DLQ/destination routing and telemetry collection points
2. WHEN documenting CI/CD flow THEN the system SHALL illustrate GitHub → OIDC → AWS → build → sign → deploy → CodeDeploy canary → alias flip → rollback sequences
3. WHEN rendering diagrams THEN the system SHALL use Mermaid format for easy integration into documentation and version control
4. WHEN showing data flows THEN the system SHALL include security boundaries, encryption points, and monitoring touchpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a complete GitHub Actions workflow example with OIDC authentication and Lambda code signing, so that I can implement secure CI/CD pipelines that enforce all production standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing the workflow THEN the system SHALL include lint, test, build, sign, and deploy stages with proper error handling
2. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL use GitHub OIDC with AWS IAM roles instead of long-lived access keys
3. WHEN implementing code signing THEN the system SHALL enforce AWS Signer integration and prevent deployment of unsigned code
4. WHEN managing deployments THEN the system SHALL use Lambda aliases, CodeDeploy canary deployments, and automated rollback capabilities
5. WHEN defining the workflow THEN the system SHALL include environment-specific configurations, approval gates, and security scanning steps
